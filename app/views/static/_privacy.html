  <h2>How We Collect Information.</h2>
  <p><u>Personal Information</u><br />
    In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you and helps us learn more about the use of the Sites and/or Services. We collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily.
  </p>
  <p>When you download the App, we may collect your device type, your wireless carrier, and your individual device ID and we associate this with your Personal Information, though we primarily use this information to support your account and provide you with Services. To use our Services, you must register through the App by connecting through Facebook (see below for information on this process), in which case we may collect information from Facebook about you, including information that you make generally available to third parties on Facebook and your mobile phone number to verify your mobile phone.</p>
  <p>Our App pulls information about your schedule from your local calendar on your mobile device as well Third Party Services hosted on third-party websites and application (e.g., Google Calendar), and we use that information to provide you certain functionality as part of the App. As this is associated with you, we consider it to be Personal Information. We may also send information back to your local calendar and address book on your mobile device and to Third Party Services.</p>
  <p>As you use the App, we will collect location-based information from you through your mobile or other location-aware device. When you communicate with us through our Sites or by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the features of the Sites or Services you are able to use.</p>
  <p>We will also collect the contact information of your friends, if you choose to connect your contacts and address book information with Fika and your login credentials to your social network accounts, such as Facebook, Foursquare and Twitter, if you choose to connect those accounts with your Fika account.<br />
    We also automatically collect certain information when you use Fika, such as your location/GPS coordinates (if you enable this feature), a device identifier, MAC address, wireless service provider, Internet Protocol (IP) address (if using a browser), operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site and your activity on Fika. You can enable or disable location services when you use Fika at anytime, through your mobile device settings. This information is not treated as personal information unless we combine it with or link it to any of the personally identifiable information mentioned above.
  </p>
  <p><u>Anonymous Information</u><br />
    As you use the Sites, certain Anonymous Information may be passively collected and stored by us or on our behalf, such as your Internet protocol address, domain names, browser type, and access times. Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) may be used to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed. "<strong>Cookies</strong>" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your browser while you are viewing a website. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of the Sites or Services.
  </p>
  <p><em>Disclosure  Third Party Cookies</em><br />
    We may use a third party tracking service such as Google Analytics or Mixpanel to track and analyze Anonymous Information from users of our Sites. Such third parties may use Cookies to help track user behavior. The use of these Cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these Cookies.
  </p>
  <p><em>Our Relationship with Third Party Services</em><br />
    We offer you interfaces that allow you to connect with third party services such as Google calendar and social networking services such as Facebook and Foursquare (collectively, "<strong>Third Party Services</strong>") through our Sites. We will work with the Third Party Services application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that Third Party Service on your behalf. In order to provide this authorization, except as set forth below, you will not provide us with your user name or password to the Third Party Service, but you will need to log-in to that Third Party Service directly through our Sites. Once authorized by you, the Third Party Service will provide us a token that allows it to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. You will be able to revoke our access to any Third Party Service at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS, though such revocation may limit the Services we are able to provide you.
  </p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the above, certain Third Party Services like Apple Calendar do not offer a developer API and we must obtain your login information to enable a connection to such Third Party Service. In such event: (i) we will use that information only to login to the Third Party Service on your behalf for the purpose of providing you content from such Third Party Service and (ii) you must use the settings in your account on the Sites or the App to revoke our access to such Third Party Service.</p>
  <p>In the event we offer our own developer API in the future, you may be able to authorize third-party applications and/or websites to access your Personal Information stored with us. We will require those applications and/or websites to agree to terms that limit their use of your information, but we do not own, operate or control those applications and/or websites. We will provide you tools to control how your information is shared with applications and websites, but you should always review the policies of third party applications and websites to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use information you share with them.</p>
